  abstract={Previous studies have examined the association between prenatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2)—a traffic emissions tracer—and fetal growth based on ultrasound measures during pregnancy. Yet, most have used exposure assessment methods with low temporal resolution, which limits the identification of critical exposure windows given that pregnancy is relatively short. Here, we used NO2 data from an ensemble model linked to residential addresses at birth to fit distributed lag models that estimated the association between weekly-resolved NO2 exposure and ultrasound biometric parameters in a Massachusetts-based cohort of 9,446 singleton births. Ultrasound biometric parameters examined included biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, time trends, and temperature. We found that higher NO2 was negatively associated with all ultrasound parameters. The critical window differed depending on the parameter and when it was assessed. For example, for BPD measured after week 31, the critical exposure window appeared to be weeks 15-25; a 10-parts per billion higher NO2 exposure sustained from conception to the time of measurement was associated with a lower mean z-score of -0.11 (95% CI: -0.17, -0.05). Our findings indicate that reducing traffic emissions is one potential avenue to improving fetal and offspring health.},

  abstract={Distributed lag models (DLMs) are often used to estimate lagged associations and identify critical exposure windows. In a simulation study of prenatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and birth weight, we demonstrate that bias amplification and variance inflation can manifest under certain combinations of DLM estimation approaches and time trend adjustment methods when using low-spatial-resolution exposures with extended lags. Our simulations showed that when using high-spatial-resolution exposure data, any time trend adjustment method produced low bias and nominal coverage for the distributed lag estimator. When using either low- or no-spatial-resolution exposures, bias due to time trends was amplified for all adjustment methods. Variance inflation was higher in low- or no-spatial-resolution DLMs when using a long-term spline to adjust for seasonality and long-term trends due to concurvity between a distributed lag function and secular function of time. NO2-birth weight analyses in a Massachusetts-based cohort showed that associations were negative for exposures experienced in gestational weeks 15-30 when using high-spatial-resolution DLMs; however, associations were null and positive for DLMs with low- and no-spatial-resolution exposures, respectively, which is likely due to bias amplification. DLM analyses should jointly consider the spatial resolution of exposure data and the parameterizations of the time trend adjustment and lag constraints.},

  author={Ritonja, Jennifer A and Aronson, Kristan J and Leung, Michael and Flaten, Lisa and Topouza, Danai G and Duan, Qing Ling and Durocher, Francine and Tranmer, Joan E and Bhatti, Parveen},
  abstract={
  Objectives: Mechanisms underlying the carcinogenicity of night shift work remain uncertain. One compelling yet understudied cancer mechanism may involve altered DNA methylation in circadian genes due to melatonin secretion patterns. The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between melatonin secretion patterns and circadian gene methylation among day and night shift workers.
  Methods: Female healthcare employees (n=38 day workers, n=36 night shift workers) for whom we had urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin secretion data from a previous study were recontacted. New blood samples were collected and used to measure methylation levels at 1150 CpG loci across 22 circadian genes using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC beadchip. Linear regression was used to examine the association between melatonin (acrophase and mesor) and M values for each CpG site (false discovery rate, q=0.2), while testing for effect modification by shift work status.
  Results: Among night shift workers, a higher mesor (24 hours of mean production of melatonin) was associated with increased methylation in the body of RORA (q=0.02) and decreased methylation in the putative promoter region of MTNR1A (q=0.03). Later acrophase (ie, time of peak concentration) was associated with increased methylation in the putative promoter region of MTNR1A (q=0.20) and decreased methylation in the body of PER3 (q=0.20). No associations were identified among day workers.
  Conclusions: In conclusion, patterns in melatonin secretion were associated with differential circadian gene methylation among night shift workers. Melatonin and alteration of DNA methylation in circadian genes may be one pathway towards increased cancer risk, although larger-scale studies examining multiple time points are needed.

  abstract={
  Background: Prior studies have examined the association between particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and fetal growth with either limited spatial or temporal resolution.
  Objectives: In this study, we examined the association between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth measures (ultrasound parameters and birth weight) in a pregnancy cohort using spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 in Eastern Massachusetts, USA.
  Methods: We used ultrasound measures of biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC), in addition to birth weight, from 9,446 pregnancies that delivered at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2011-2016. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the associations of PM2.5 in two exposure windows (first 16 weeks of pregnancy and cumulative exposure up until the assessment of fetal growth) with anatomic scans (ultrasound measures <24 weeks), growth scans (ultrasound measures ≥24 weeks), and birth weight. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, long-term trends, and temperature.
  Results: Higher PM2.5 exposure in the first 16 weeks was associated with smaller fetal growth measures, where associations were particularly strong for BPD, AC, and birth weight. For example, a 5 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a lower mean BPD z-score of -0.19 (95% CI: -0.31, -0.06) before 24 weeks, a lower mean AC z-score of -0.15 (95% CI: -0.28, -0.01) after 24 weeks, and a lower mean birth weight z-score of -0.11 (95% CI: -0.20, -0.01). Analyses examining the associations with cumulative PM2.5 exposure up until the assessment of fetal growth produced attenuated associations.
  Conclusions: Higher gestational exposure to PM2.5 was associated with smaller fetal growth measures at levels below the current national standards.

  author={Jahn, Jaquelyn L and Krieger, Nancy and Ag{\'e}nor, Madina and Leung, Michael and Davis, Brigette A and Weisskopf, Marc G and Chen, Jarvis T},
  abstract={
  Background: Fatal police violence in the United States disproportionately affects Black, Native American, and Hispanic people, and for these groups it is a racially oppressive population-level stressor that we hypothesize increases the risk of pregnancy loss. Focusing on core based statical areas (CBSAs) surrounding small and large urban centers, we accordingly tested whether gestational exposure to fatal police violence decreased the number of live births, which is reflective of a rise in lost pregnancies. Methods: Our observational study linked microdata for all births (N = 7,709,300) in 520 CBSAs with at least one incident of fatal police violence in 2013–2015 to Fatal Encounters, a database that prospectively identified 2594 police-related fatalities using online media reports and public records. We estimated the association between month-to-month fatal police violence and conceptions resulting in live births using distributed lag quasi-Poisson models with CBSA-level fixed effects, adjusted for seasonality and stratified by maternal race/ethnicity. Findings: For each additional police-related fatality that occurred in the first through sixth months of gestation, we observed a 0.14% decrease (95% confidence interval: 0.05%, 0.23%) in the total number of live births within CBSAs, and a 0.29% decrease in births to Black women (95% CI: 0.11%, 0.48%). The association was null for births to White women. Interpretation: Our findings suggest fatal police violence may have population-level consequences for pregnancy loss and adds to the evidence regarding the importance of preventing these fatalities. Funding: This study was supported in part by NIH grant P30ES00002 to MGW.

  title={Bias due to selection on live births in studies of environmental exposures during pregnancy: a simulation study},
  author={Leung, Michael and Kioumourtzoglou, Marianthi-Anna and Raz, Raanan and Weisskopf, Marc G},
  abstract={
  Background: Studies of the effects of prenatal environmental exposures on postnatal outcomes are particularly vulnerable to live birth bias; that is, the bias that arises from the necessary restriction of the analysis to live births when that is influenced by both the exposure under study A and unmeasured factors U that also affect the outcome.
  Objectives: In the context of a recent publication of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that found an odds ratio (OR) of 0.77 per 5.85 ppb NO2 during pregnancy, we aimed to examine what parameters would be needed to account for this protective association through live birth bias.
  Methods: We simulated the magnitude of bias under two selection mechanisms and when both mechanisms co-occur, assuming a true null effect. Simulation input parameters were based on characteristics of the original study and a range of plausible values for the prevalence of unmeasured factor U and the ORs for the selection effects (i.e., the effects of NO2 and U on loss, and U on ASD). Each scenario was simulated 1000 times.
  Results: We found that the magnitude of bias was small when NO2 and U independently influenced pregnancy loss (collider-stratification without interaction), was stronger when NO2-induced loss preferentially occurred in U=1 (depletion of susceptibles), and strongest when both mechanisms worked together. For example, ORs of 3.0 for NO2-loss, U-loss, U-ASD and U prevalence=0.75 yielded NO2-ASD ORs per 5.85 ppb NO2 of 0.95, 0.89, and 0.75 for the three scenarios, respectively. The bias is amplified with multiple Us, yielding ORs as low as 0.51.
  Discussion: Our simulations illustrate that live birth bias may lead to exposure-outcome associations that are biased downwards, where the extent of the bias depends on the fetal selection mechanism, the strength of that selection, and the prevalence of U.

  abstract={
  Daily oral vitamin D supplementation (400 IU) is recommended for breastfeeding infants (≤1 y). Recent studies have examined alternative approaches to preventing vitamin D deficiency in this population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effects of maternal postpartum (M-PP) or infant intermittent (I-INT) vitamin D supplementation on infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in comparison to routine direct infant daily (I-D) oral supplementation (400 IU). MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to December 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of published, peer-reviewed, vitamin D intervention trials involving lactating women and/or exclusively or partially breastfed term infants. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics (e.g., sample size, intervention dose, and duration and mode of administration) and related biochemical and clinical outcomes. Of 28 included trials, 5 randomized controlled trials were incorporated in meta-analyses examining infant 25(OH)D. Overall, M-PP supplementation resulted in modestly lower infant 25(OH)D compared with I-D supplementation (weighted mean difference = −8.1 nmol/L; 95% CI: −15.4, −0.9; I2 = 45%; P = 0.14; 3 trials), but the 2 most recent trials found M-PP to achieve similar infant 25(OH)D as I-D. Comparison of I-INT with I-D was confined to 2 trials with contradictory findings, and it was considered inappropriate for pooled analysis. Meta-analysis was therefore limited by a small number of eligible trials with variable quality of analytically derived 25(OH)D data and inconsistent reporting of safety outcomes, including effects on calcium homeostasis. Considering all 28 included trials, this systematic review highlights M-PP and I-INT regimens as plausible substitutes for routine daily infant vitamin D supplementation, but evidence remains too weak to support a policy update. Dose-ranging, adequately powered trials are required to establish the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of alternative strategies to prevent vitamin D deficiency in breastfeeding infants. This review was registered with PROSPERO as CRD42017069905.

  author={Leung, Michael and Krishna, Aditi and Yang, Seungmi and Bassani, Diego G and Roth, Daniel E},
  abstract={
  Objective: To illustrate that a mediation framework can help integrate inferences from three growth models to enable a comprehensive view of the associations between growth during specific developmental windows and mid-childhood IQ.
  Design: We analysed direct and indirect associations between mid-childhood IQ and length/height growth in five early-life age intervals bounded by conception, birth, early, mid and late infancy, and mid-childhood using estimates from three growth models (lifecourse, conditional change and change score) applied to three historical birth cohorts.
  Participants: and setting 12 088 term-born children from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) in the USA (n=2170), the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) in Belarus (n=8275) and the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) in the Philippines (n=1643).
  Primary outcome measure: Mid-childhood IQ.
  Results: Our analyses revealed cross-cohort and cross-interval variations in the direct and indirect effects of foetal and early childhood physical growth on mid-childhood IQ. For example, in CPP, there was a direct association of prenatal growth with IQ that was not evident in the other cohorts, whereas in PROBIT and CLHNS, we observed that foetal and early growth-IQ associations were mediated through size in later periods.
  Conclusion: Lifecourse, conditional change and change score growth models yield complementary inferences when appropriately interpreted. Future longitudinal studies of associations of early-life growth with later outcomes would benefit from adopting a causal mediation framework to integrate inferences from multiple complementary growth models.

  abstract={
  Information about the human burdens of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in low- and middle-income countries is limited. In particular, studies often include only a small subset of POPs. To address this data gap, we aimed to assess maternal-child exposures to POPs in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We quantified 16 organochlorine pesticides, 12 polychlorinated biphenyls, 21 brominated flame retardants, 18 per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances, 2 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and short-chain chlorinated paraffins in 18 pooled samples of human cord blood from 90 mother–infant pairs living in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2014–2015). In all pooled samples, we detected high levels of p,p′-DDT (median 81.6 ng/g lipid) and its metabolites p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDD (median 551 and 10.7 ng/g lipid, respectively), where the p,p′-DDE/p,p′-DDT ratio ranged from 2.9 to 9.8 indicating recent dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) exposure. We also detected acenaphthene, decabromodiphenyl ethane, o,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDE, hexachlorobenzene, β-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexabromobenzene, and perfluorooctanoic acid in a subset of samples. For the other 59 target compounds, concentrations were below the limits of detection, despite using ultra-trace analytical methodology. No trends were observed when stratifying the analyses of detected POP concentrations by maternal age, maternal body mass index, or large fish consumption. These findings highlight recent DDT exposure in Dhaka, but the overall POP burden was otherwise low in this sample of pregnant women/newborns. Future monitoring efforts should focus on newly detected POPs for which burdens may be increasing due to ongoing industrialization in Bangladesh.

  abstract={Metrics to quantify child growth vary across studies of the developmental origins of health and disease.

From a 10% random sample of eligible studies published between Jan 2010-Jun 2016, and all eligible studies from Oct 2015-June 2016, we classified growth metrics based on author-assigned labels (e.g., ‘weight gain’) and a ‘content signature’, a numeric code that summarized the metric’s conceptual and statistical properties. Heterogeneity was assessed by the number of unique content signatures, and label-to-content concordance. In 122 studies, we found 40 unique metrics of childhood growth. The most common approach to quantifying growth in length, weight or BMI was the calculation of each child’s change in z-score. Label-to-content discordance was common due to distinct content signatures carrying the same label, and because of instances in which the same content signature was assigned multiple different labels. In conclusion, the numerous distinct growth metrics and the lack of specificity in the application of metric labels challenge the integration of data and inferences from studies investigating the determinants or consequences of variations in childhood growth.},

  abstract={
  Sleep disturbance is common among shift workers, and may be an important factor in the effect of shift work on chronic disease development. In this cross-sectional study, we described sleep patterns of 294 female hospital workers (142 alternating day-night shift workers, 152 day workers) and determined associations between shift work and sleep duration. Rest-activity cycles were recorded with the ActiGraph GT3X+ for 1 week. Analyses were stratified by chronotype of shift workers. Using all study days to calculate average sleep duration, shift workers slept approximately 13 min less than day workers during main sleep periods, while 24-h sleep duration did not differ between day workers and shift workers. Results from age-adjusted models demonstrated that all shift workers, regardless of chronotype, slept 20-30 min less than day workers on day shifts during main and total sleep. Early and intermediate chronotypes working night shifts slept between 114 and 125 min less than day workers, both with regard to the main sleep episode and 24-h sleep duration, while the difference was less pronounced among late chronotypes. When sleep duration on free days was compared between shift workers and day workers, only shift workers with late chronotypes slept less, by approximately 50 min, than day workers during main sleep. Results from this study demonstrate how an alternating day-night shift work schedule impacts sleep negatively among female hospital workers, and the importance of considering chronotype in sleep research among shift workers.

  abstract={
  Objectives: To estimate the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on 11 maternal and 27 neonatal/infant outcomes; to determine frequencies at which trial outcome data were missing, unreported, or inconsistently reported; and to project the potential contributions of registered ongoing or planned trials.
  Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials; systematic review of registered but unpublished trials.
  Data sources: Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to September 2017; manual searches of reference lists of systematic reviews identified in the electronic search; and online trial registries for unpublished, ongoing, or planned trials.
  Eligibility criteria for study selection Trials of prenatal vitamin D supplementation with randomised allocation and control groups administered placebo, no vitamin D, or vitamin D ≤600 IU/day (or its equivalent), and published in a peer reviewed journal.
  Results: 43 trials (8406 participants) were eligible for meta-analyses. Median sample size was 133 participants. Vitamin D increased maternal/cord serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, but the dose-response effect was weak. Maternal clinical outcomes were rarely ascertained or reported, but available data did not provide evidence of benefits. Overall, vitamin D increased mean birth weight of 58.33 g (95% confidence interval 18.88 g to 97.78 g; 37 comparisons) and reduced the risk of small for gestational age births (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.90; seven comparisons), but findings were not robust in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. There was no effect on preterm birth (1.0, 0.77 to 1.30; 15 comparisons). There was strong evidence that prenatal vitamin D reduced the risk of offspring wheeze by age 3 years (0.81, 0.67 to 0.98; two comparisons). For most outcomes, meta-analyses included data from a minority of trials. Only eight of 43 trials (19%) had an overall low risk of bias. Thirty five planned/ongoing randomised controlled trials could contribute 12 530 additional participants to future reviews.
  Conclusions: Most trials on prenatal vitamin D published by September 2017 were small and of low quality. The evidence to date seems insufficient to guide clinical or policy recommendations. Future trials should be designed and powered to examine clinical endpoints, including maternal conditions related to pregnancy (such as pre-eclampsia), infant growth, and respiratory outcomes.

  title={Early childhood linear growth faltering in low-income and middle-income countries as a whole-population condition: analysis of 179 Demographic and Health Surveys from 64 countries (1993--2015)},
  abstract={
  Background: The causes of early childhood linear growth faltering (known as stunting) in low-income and middle-income countries remain inadequately understood. We aimed to determine if the progressive postnatal decline in mean height-for-age Z score (HAZ) in low-income and middle-income countries is driven by relatively slow growth of certain high-risk children versus faltering of the entire population.
  Methods: Distributions of HAZ (based on WHO growth standards) were analysed in 3-month age intervals from 0 to 36 months of age in 179 Demographic and Health Surveys from 64 low-income and middle-income countries (1993–2015). Mean, standard deviation (SD), fifth percentiles, and 95th percentiles of the HAZ distribution were estimated for each age interval in each survey. Associations between mean HAZ and SD, fifth percentile, and 95th percentile were estimated using multilevel linear models. Stratified analyses were performed in consideration of potential modifiers (world region, national income, sample size, year, or mean HAZ in the 0–3 month age band). We also used Monte Carlo simulations to model the effects of subgroup versus whole-population faltering on the HAZ distribution.
  Findings: Declines in mean HAZ from birth to 3 years of age were accompanied by declines in both the fifth and 95th percentiles, leading to nearly symmetrical narrowing of the HAZ distributions. Thus, children with relatively low HAZ were not more likely to have faltered than taller same-age peers. Inferences were unchanged in surveys regardless of world region, national income, sample size, year, or mean HAZ in the 0–3 month age band. Simulations showed that the narrowing of the HAZ distribution as mean HAZ declined could not be explained by faltering limited to a growth-restricted subgroup of children.
  Interpretation: In low-income and middle-income countries, declines in mean HAZ with age are due to a downward shift in the entire HAZ distribution, revealing that children across the HAZ spectrum experience slower growth compared to the international standard. Efforts to mitigate postnatal linear growth faltering in low-income and middle-income countries should prioritise action on community-level determinants of childhood HAZ trajectories.

  title={Conditional random slope: A new approach for estimating individual child growth velocity in epidemiological research},
  abstract={
  Objectives: Conditioning child growth measures on baseline accounts for regression to the mean (RTM). Here, we present the “conditional random slope” (CRS) model, based on a linear-mixed effects model that incorporates a baseline-time interaction term that can accommodate multiple data points for a child while also directly accounting for RTM.
  Methods: In two birth cohorts, we applied five approaches to estimate child growth velocities from 0 to 12 months to assess the effect of increasing data density (number of measures per child) on the magnitude of RTM of unconditional estimates, and the correlation and concordance between the CRS and four alternative metrics. Further, we demonstrated the differential effect of the choice of velocity metric on the magnitude of the association between infant growth and stunting at 2 years.
  Results: RTM was minimally attenuated by increasing data density for unconditional growth modeling approaches. CRS and classical conditional models gave nearly identical estimates with two measures per child. Compared to the CRS estimates, unconditional metrics had moderate correlation (r = 0.65–0.91), but poor agreement in the classification of infants with relatively slow growth (kappa = 0.38–0.78). Estimates of the velocity-stunting association were the same for CRS and classical conditional models but differed substantially between conditional versus unconditional metrics.
  Conclusion: The CRS can leverage the flexibility of linear mixed models while addressing RTM in longitudinal analyses.

  title={Shift work parameters and disruption of diurnal cortisol production in female hospital employees},
  abstract={
  Shift work is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Disruption of cortisol production is a potential underlying mechanism. This study explored the associations of diurnal quantity and pattern of cortisol production in relation to (1) current shift work status (exclusive day versus rotating days and nights), (2) years of past shift work and (3) parameters of rotating shift work (timing, length and intensity). Female hospital employees (160 day workers and 168 rotating shift workers) from southeastern Ontario, Canada, participated in a cross-sectional study. Participants completed a baseline questionnaire and measures of body height, weight, and waist circumference were taken. Midstream urine samples were collected over two separate 24-hour periods to measure creatinine-adjusted cortisol. Total diurnal cortisol production and pattern were described with two measures of the area under the curve. The effect of shift work on cortisol was modeled using multivariable linear regression analyses. Cortisol production in day workers and shift workers on their day shift were similar; however, shift workers on the night shift had flatter diurnal cortisol curves and produced less cortisol. This suggests that night work is associated with an acute attenuation of cortisol production.

  title={Shift work, chronotype, and melatonin patterns among female hospital employees on day and night shifts},
  author={Leung, Michael and Tranmer, Joan and Hung, Eleanor and Korsiak, Jill and Day, Andrew G and Aronson, Kristan J},
  abstract={
  Background: Shift work-related carcinogenesis is hypothesized to be mediated by melatonin; however, few studies have considered the potential effect modification of this underlying pathway by chronotype or specific aspects of shift work such as the number of consecutive nights in a rotation. In this study, we examined melatonin patterns in relation to shift status, stratified by chronotype and number of consecutive night shifts, and cumulative lifetime exposure to shift work.
  Methods: Melatonin patterns of 261 female personnel (147 fixed-day and 114 on rotations, including nights) at Kingston General Hospital were analyzed using cosinor analysis. Urine samples were collected from all voids over a 48-hour specimen collection period for measurement of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin concentrations using the Buhlmann ELISA Kit. Chronotypes were assessed using mid-sleep time (MSF) derived from the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). Sociodemographic, health, and occupational information were collected by questionnaire.
  Results: Rotational shift nurses working nights had a lower mesor and an earlier time of peak melatonin production compared to day-only workers. More pronounced differences in mesor and acrophase were seen among later chronotypes, and shift workers working ≥3 consecutive nights. Among nurses, cumulative shift work was associated with a reduction in mesor.
  Conclusion: These results suggest that evening-types and/or shift workers working ≥3 consecutive nights are more susceptible to adverse light-at-night effects, whereas long-term shift work may also chronically reduce melatonin levels.
  Impact: Cumulative and current exposure to shift work, including nights, affects level and timing of melatonin production, which may be related to carcinogenesis and cancer risk.
