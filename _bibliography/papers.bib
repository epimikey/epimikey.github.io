  abstract={Previous studies have examined the association between prenatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2)—a traffic emissions tracer—and fetal growth based on ultrasound measures during pregnancy. Yet, most have used exposure assessment methods with low temporal resolution, which limits the identification of critical exposure windows given that pregnancy is relatively short. Here, we used NO2 data from an ensemble model linked to residential addresses at birth to fit distributed lag models that estimated the association between weekly-resolved NO2 exposure and ultrasound biometric parameters in a Massachusetts-based cohort of 9,446 singleton births. Ultrasound biometric parameters examined included biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference, femur length, and abdominal circumference. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, time trends, and temperature. We found that higher NO2 was negatively associated with all ultrasound parameters. The critical window differed depending on the parameter and when it was assessed. For example, for BPD measured after week 31, the critical exposure window appeared to be weeks 15-25; a 10-parts per billion higher NO2 exposure sustained from conception to the time of measurement was associated with a lower mean z-score of -0.11 (95% CI: -0.17, -0.05). Our findings indicate that reducing traffic emissions is one potential avenue to improving fetal and offspring health.},

  author={Leung, Michael and Rowland, Sebastian and Coull, Brent and Modest, Anna M and Hacker, Michele R and Schwartz, Joel and Kioumourtzoglou, Marianthi-Anna and Weisskopf, Marc G and Wilson Ander},
  abstract={Distributed lag models (DLMs) are often used to estimate lagged associations and identify critical exposure windows. In a simulation study of prenatal nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and birth weight, we demonstrate that bias amplification and variance inflation can manifest under certain combinations of DLM estimation approaches and time trend adjustment methods when using low-spatial-resolution exposures with extended lags. Our simulations showed that when using high-spatial-resolution exposure data, any time trend adjustment method produced low bias and nominal coverage for the distributed lag estimator. When using either low- or no-spatial-resolution exposures, bias due to time trends was amplified for all adjustment methods. Variance inflation was higher in low- or no-spatial-resolution DLMs when using a long-term spline to adjust for seasonality and long-term trends due to concurvity between a distributed lag function and secular function of time. NO2-birth weight analyses in a Massachusetts-based cohort showed that associations were negative for exposures experienced in gestational weeks 15-30 when using high-spatial-resolution DLMs; however, associations were null and positive for DLMs with low- and no-spatial-resolution exposures, respectively, which is likely due to bias amplification. DLM analyses should jointly consider the spatial resolution of exposure data and the parameterizations of the time trend adjustment and lag constraints.},

  abstract={
  Background: Prior studies have examined the association between particulate matter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and fetal growth with either limited spatial or temporal resolution.
  Objectives: In this study, we examined the association between PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth measures (ultrasound parameters and birth weight) in a pregnancy cohort using spatiotemporally resolved PM2.5 in Eastern Massachusetts, USA.
  Methods: We used ultrasound measures of biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), femur length (FL), and abdominal circumference (AC), in addition to birth weight, from 9,446 pregnancies that delivered at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2011-2016. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the associations of PM2.5 in two exposure windows (first 16 weeks of pregnancy and cumulative exposure up until the assessment of fetal growth) with anatomic scans (ultrasound measures <24 weeks), growth scans (ultrasound measures ≥24 weeks), and birth weight. All models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, long-term trends, and temperature.
  Results: Higher PM2.5 exposure in the first 16 weeks was associated with smaller fetal growth measures, where associations were particularly strong for BPD, AC, and birth weight. For example, a 5 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a lower mean BPD z-score of -0.19 (95% CI: -0.31, -0.06) before 24 weeks, a lower mean AC z-score of -0.15 (95% CI: -0.28, -0.01) after 24 weeks, and a lower mean birth weight z-score of -0.11 (95% CI: -0.20, -0.01). Analyses examining the associations with cumulative PM2.5 exposure up until the assessment of fetal growth produced attenuated associations.
  Conclusions: Higher gestational exposure to PM2.5 was associated with smaller fetal growth measures at levels below the current national standards.

  author={Jahn, Jaquelyn L and Krieger, Nancy and Ag{\'e}nor, Madina and Leung, Michael and Davis, Brigette A and Weisskopf, Marc G and Chen, Jarvis T},
  abstract={
  Background: Fatal police violence in the United States disproportionately affects Black, Native American, and Hispanic people, and for these groups it is a racially oppressive population-level stressor that we hypothesize increases the risk of pregnancy loss. Focusing on core based statical areas (CBSAs) surrounding small and large urban centers, we accordingly tested whether gestational exposure to fatal police violence decreased the number of live births, which is reflective of a rise in lost pregnancies. Methods: Our observational study linked microdata for all births (N = 7,709,300) in 520 CBSAs with at least one incident of fatal police violence in 2013–2015 to Fatal Encounters, a database that prospectively identified 2594 police-related fatalities using online media reports and public records. We estimated the association between month-to-month fatal police violence and conceptions resulting in live births using distributed lag quasi-Poisson models with CBSA-level fixed effects, adjusted for seasonality and stratified by maternal race/ethnicity. Findings: For each additional police-related fatality that occurred in the first through sixth months of gestation, we observed a 0.14% decrease (95% confidence interval: 0.05%, 0.23%) in the total number of live births within CBSAs, and a 0.29% decrease in births to Black women (95% CI: 0.11%, 0.48%). The association was null for births to White women. Interpretation: Our findings suggest fatal police violence may have population-level consequences for pregnancy loss and adds to the evidence regarding the importance of preventing these fatalities. Funding: This study was supported in part by NIH grant P30ES00002 to MGW.

  title={Bias due to selection on live births in studies of environmental exposures during pregnancy: a simulation study},
  author={Leung, Michael and Kioumourtzoglou, Marianthi-Anna and Raz, Raanan and Weisskopf, Marc G},
  abstract={
  Background: Studies of the effects of prenatal environmental exposures on postnatal outcomes are particularly vulnerable to live birth bias; that is, the bias that arises from the necessary restriction of the analysis to live births when that is influenced by both the exposure under study A and unmeasured factors U that also affect the outcome.
  Objectives: In the context of a recent publication of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that found an odds ratio (OR) of 0.77 per 5.85 ppb NO2 during pregnancy, we aimed to examine what parameters would be needed to account for this protective association through live birth bias.
  Methods: We simulated the magnitude of bias under two selection mechanisms and when both mechanisms co-occur, assuming a true null effect. Simulation input parameters were based on characteristics of the original study and a range of plausible values for the prevalence of unmeasured factor U and the ORs for the selection effects (i.e., the effects of NO2 and U on loss, and U on ASD). Each scenario was simulated 1000 times.
  Results: We found that the magnitude of bias was small when NO2 and U independently influenced pregnancy loss (collider-stratification without interaction), was stronger when NO2-induced loss preferentially occurred in U=1 (depletion of susceptibles), and strongest when both mechanisms worked together. For example, ORs of 3.0 for NO2-loss, U-loss, U-ASD and U prevalence=0.75 yielded NO2-ASD ORs per 5.85 ppb NO2 of 0.95, 0.89, and 0.75 for the three scenarios, respectively. The bias is amplified with multiple Us, yielding ORs as low as 0.51.
  Discussion: Our simulations illustrate that live birth bias may lead to exposure-outcome associations that are biased downwards, where the extent of the bias depends on the fetal selection mechanism, the strength of that selection, and the prevalence of U.

  title={Vitamin D in breastfed infants: systematic review of alternatives to daily supplementation},
  author={O'Callaghan, Karen M and Taghivand, Mahgol and Zuchniak, Anna and Onoyovwi, Akpevwe and Korsiak, Jill and Leung, Michael and Roth, Daniel E},
  abstract={
  Daily oral vitamin D supplementation (400 IU) is recommended for breastfeeding infants (≤1 y). Recent studies have examined alternative approaches to preventing vitamin D deficiency in this population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effects of maternal postpartum (M-PP) or infant intermittent (I-INT) vitamin D supplementation on infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in comparison to routine direct infant daily (I-D) oral supplementation (400 IU). MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to December 2018. Inclusion criteria consisted of published, peer-reviewed, vitamin D intervention trials involving lactating women and/or exclusively or partially breastfed term infants. Two reviewers independently extracted study characteristics (e.g., sample size, intervention dose, and duration and mode of administration) and related biochemical and clinical outcomes. Of 28 included trials, 5 randomized controlled trials were incorporated in meta-analyses examining infant 25(OH)D. Overall, M-PP supplementation resulted in modestly lower infant 25(OH)D compared with I-D supplementation (weighted mean difference = −8.1 nmol/L; 95% CI: −15.4, −0.9; I2 = 45%; P = 0.14; 3 trials), but the 2 most recent trials found M-PP to achieve similar infant 25(OH)D as I-D. Comparison of I-INT with I-D was confined to 2 trials with contradictory findings, and it was considered inappropriate for pooled analysis. Meta-analysis was therefore limited by a small number of eligible trials with variable quality of analytically derived 25(OH)D data and inconsistent reporting of safety outcomes, including effects on calcium homeostasis. Considering all 28 included trials, this systematic review highlights M-PP and I-INT regimens as plausible substitutes for routine daily infant vitamin D supplementation, but evidence remains too weak to support a policy update. Dose-ranging, adequately powered trials are required to establish the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of alternative strategies to prevent vitamin D deficiency in breastfeeding infants. This review was registered with PROSPERO as CRD42017069905.

  author={Leung, Michael and Krishna, Aditi and Yang, Seungmi and Bassani, Diego G and Roth, Daniel E},
  abstract={
  Objective To illustrate that a mediation framework can help integrate inferences from three growth models to enable a comprehensive view of the associations between growth during specific developmental windows and mid-childhood IQ.
  Design We analysed direct and indirect associations between mid-childhood IQ and length/height growth in five early-life age intervals bounded by conception, birth, early, mid and late infancy, and mid-childhood using estimates from three growth models (lifecourse, conditional change and change score) applied to three historical birth cohorts.
  Participants and setting 12 088 term-born children from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) in the USA (n=2170), the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) in Belarus (n=8275) and the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS) in the Philippines (n=1643).
  Primary outcome measure Mid-childhood IQ.
  Results Our analyses revealed cross-cohort and cross-interval variations in the direct and indirect effects of foetal and early childhood physical growth on mid-childhood IQ. For example, in CPP, there was a direct association of prenatal growth with IQ that was not evident in the other cohorts, whereas in PROBIT and CLHNS, we observed that foetal and early growth-IQ associations were mediated through size in later periods.
  Conclusion Lifecourse, conditional change and change score growth models yield complementary inferences when appropriately interpreted. Future longitudinal studies of associations of early-life growth with later outcomes would benefit from adopting a causal mediation framework to integrate inferences from multiple complementary growth models.
